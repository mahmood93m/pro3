        <p>
        The Culture of Iran also known as Culture of Persia, is one of the most
        influential cultures in the world. Iran is considered as one of the
        cradles of civilization, and due to its dominant geo-political position
        and culture in the world, Iran has heavily influenced cultures and
        peoples as far away as Italy, Macedonia, and Greece to the West, Russia
        and Eastern Europe to the North, the Arabian Peninsula to the South, and
        the Indian subcontinent and East Asia to the East. Iran's rich history
        has had a significant impact on the world through art, architecture,
        poetry, science and technology, medicine, philosophy and engineering.

        <h1>Iranian&nbsp;foods</h1>
        <p>
        Typical Iranian main dishes are combinations of rice with meat,
        vegetables, and nuts. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such
        as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins.
        Characteristic Iranian flavorings such as saffron, dried lime and other
        sources of sour flavoring, cinnamon, turmeric, and parsley are mixed and
        used in various dishes.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Zereshk&nbsp;polo</h4>
          <p>
            The sweet and sour flavour of zereshk (barberries) and the
            glistening ruby red berries set against the white and saffron tinged
            grains make this a feast for the taste buds and the eyes. Zereshk
            polo is served at weddings and other celebrations because it is
            impressive and easy to make in large quantities. It is usually
            served with chicken, but it is also delicious with Saffron yogurt
            lamb

          <h4>Chelo&nbsp;kabab&nbsp;koobideh</h4>
          <p>
            Kebabs have more variety than you might think. First, there’s
            Koobideh, ground meat seasoned with minced onion, salt and pepper.
            It sounds simple, but the taste is sublime. There is kebab-e Barg,
            thinly sliced lamb or beef, flavored with lemon juice and onion and
            basted with saffron and butter. Chicken kebab, known as Joojeh, is
            traditionally made from a whole chicken, bones and all, for more
            flavor (although in American restaurants it’s often made from
            skinless chicken breast), marinated in lemon and onion, and basted
            with saffron and butter. If you’re lucky, you’ll find jigar, lamb
            liver kebab, garnished with fresh basil leaves and a wedge of lemon.

          <h4>Tahchin</h4>
          <p>
            Tahchin is an Iranian rice cake that includes rice, yogurt, saffron,
            egg, and chicken fillets. It is also possible to use vegetables,
            fish, or meat instead of the chicken fillets. Tahchin is composed of
            two different parts: The thin Tahdig part which includes the chicken
            fillets, saffron, and other ingredients at the bottom of the cooking
            pot and the second part which is the white rice. In restaurants,
            Tahchin is mostly prepared and served without the white rice part.

          <h4>Khoresht-e&nbsp;gheimeh</h4>
          <p>
            Before the introduction of electric fridges, families in the colder,
            northern provinces of Iran such as Azerbaijan devised ingenious ways
            to preserve meat for consumption during the winter months. The meat
            would be cut into small pieces (gheimeh), fried with onions,
            flavoured with turmeric and other spices and put into big
            earthenware vats. A thick layer of solidified fat on the top ensures
            a good seal against micro-organisms. These vats were kept in dark,
            cold basements over the winter. Each day, a small amount would be
            taken to add to the khoresht. Khoresht-e gheimeh is diced meat
            combined with yellow split peas, dried limes and saffron with fried
            potatoes. It is very popular all over Iran and can be cooked all
            year round; the combination of meat and pulses, served with rice,
            provides a nutritious meal.
